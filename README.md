# Release-Point-Consistency
This is the code for my research project on release point consistency in MLB pitchers. The first part of the project is now published on Substack, please check it out!

To replicate and expand on the work in the article, just run the code in Release Point Consistency Within Pitches.ipynb.

The only thing you need is to download the fangraphs_pitcher_key.csv file locally. There is a place in the Jupyter notebook to update your path to this file, and it will enable the connection between Baseball Savant and FanGraphs data.

Please reach out to me, Simon Todreas, with any questions or comments on my LinkedIn!
